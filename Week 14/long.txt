I'm Batman The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.

 Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

 I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.

 This isn't a car. Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. Swear to me! It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.
