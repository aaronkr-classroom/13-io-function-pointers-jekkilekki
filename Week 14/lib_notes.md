A `.lib file` in Visual Studio is not a source file.
It is a compiled binary library, created from `.c` files.
That's why when you type code in a .lib file, Visual Studio shows no syntax coloring: .lib files are not meant to be opened or edited as source.

You should never write C code directly in a .lib file.

✅ Correct way to create a .lib in Visual Studio
1. Create a new project

File → New → Project → Static Library (.lib)
Choose:

C/C++

Project type: Static Library

This project will output a .lib file automatically.

2. Add your files

Inside this Static Library project:

File → Add → New Item → C++ File (.c)

Create:

my_math.c


Copy your function definitions into my_math.c (NOT into a .lib file!).

#include "my_math.h"

int Sum(...) { ... }
int Sub(...) { ... }
...

Add your header
my_math.h


Keep only the function prototypes in the header:

#pragma once
int Sum(int a, int b, void(*pa)(int*), void(*pb)(int*));
...

3. Build the library

Build the static library project:

Build → Build Solution

Visual Studio will generate:

MyMath.lib         ← the compiled static library
MyMath.pdb         ← debugging symbols


This .lib is what you link to from other projects.

4. Use the .lib in another project

In your main application project:

(A) Include the header
#include "my_math.h"

(B) Link the .lib

Right-click your main project:

Properties → Linker → Input → Additional Dependencies

Add:

MyMath.lib

(C) Ensure path is known

Linker → General → Additional Library Directories

Add the folder containing your .lib.

📌 Summary
What you did	Correct behavior
Edited a .lib file as if it were source	❌ Not allowed — .lib is a binary file
No syntax coloring	✔ Normal — Visual Studio does not color binary files
Wondering how to create a .lib	✔ Create a Static Library project
⭐ Final answer

You should never write code in a .lib file.
A .lib is generated by compiling .c files inside a Static Library project.
Put your function definitions into a .c file, compile the library, and Visual Studio will output a valid .lib automatically.
